This was part of a nuget package. You can safely remove this file from your project and delete it.

Why this file ?
-------------------
Nuget packages are of 2 possible levels, solution and project, predetermined by the content of the nuget package.
At the actual state of nuget's development, there is no way to create a project level package that does not have any content or library.
This file was added to a nuget package to make it recognized as an project level package, and not a solution level package.

You can remove this file once the package is installed.
